### OpenJDK is moving to GitHub

[Project Skara](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/skara/) (see: [wiki](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/SKARA)) was created a while ago to investigate alternative SCM and code review options for the JDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than Mercurial. Two connected JEPs were also created:
- [JEP 357: Migrate from Mercurial to Git](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/357)
- [JEP 369: Migrate to GitHub](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/369)

Both were proposed to target JDK 16, now the exact target date for the transition of the `jdk/jdk` repository is [set to Saturday September 5, 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2020-August/004588.html). Here you can find the repo on GitHub: [openjdk/jdk](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk).

There's also an article on jaxenter if you want to read more: [Java 16: Migration to Git and GitHub gets closer](https://jaxenter.com/java-16-migration-to-git-and-github-jdk-172076.html)

### A peek at the roadmap for pattern matching and more

Brian Goetz sketched out a rough roadmap for pattern matching, [see it on the Amber Expert Group mailing list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-August/002318.html).

### Serializable Records

An article about Record serialization and how it differs from serialization of normal classes: [Serializable Records](https://inside.java/2020/07/20/serializablerecords/).  
Fyi: this is about Java's object serialization (`ObjectInputStream` and `ObjectOutputStream`) not about xml, json, etc.
